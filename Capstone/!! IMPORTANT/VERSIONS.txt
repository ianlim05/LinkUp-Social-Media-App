DEV VERSION 1.0 CHANGELOG (Done by Dylan)

REWROTE IAN LIM'S CODE TO MORE FLEXIBLE FOR header.php, ALLOWING EASIER IMPORTS (<?php import>)
ADDED A 3 NEW FOLDER CALLED IMPORTANT, GENERAL AND IMAGES FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY AND ORGANISATION.
RENAMED index.php TO header.php
Removed majority of people's code to implement header.php. Double check if your css is having issue.

Comment:
Althought I have already compiled, some part might cause a little bug, so double check your part and see if you have any error.
Don't focus on CSS now, focus on functionality first.
Be aware some image might be missing and I've not dragged Chan's Image to IMAGE folder.
if possible Chan can you drag your own images to the images folder since you know your code the most out of us all.
